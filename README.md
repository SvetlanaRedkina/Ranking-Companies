## Companies.sql
- You will find three tables in Companies.sql: 
    
     Companies

     projectDates
     
     petCompanies

- The queries in Companies.sql include commented explanations of similarities and differencies between ranking functions:

     rank() and rank() with partition by

     dense_rank() and dense_rank() with partition by

     row_number() and row_number() with partition by

     lead() and lag()

- The screnshots of the tables show how the tables look after values have been inserted into them
