## Ranking-Companies

Ranking functions are super helpful 👍 in SQL but can sometimes be confusing.This is how I came up with an idea of this project ✨. I wanted ranking functions to be under my belt 💪, so I would use them within my derived tables or CTE. I will be glad if my project is useful to someone else 😊.


### Companies.sql
- You will find three tables in Companies.sql: Companies, projectDates, and petCompanies. 
- Each query in Companies.sql  achieves a certain task and includes explanations of similarities and differencies between ranking functions:

     1️⃣ rank() and rank() with partition by
     
     2️⃣ dense_rank() and dense_rank() with partition by
     
     3️⃣ row_number() and row_number() with partition by
     
     4️⃣ lead() and lag()

- The screnshots of the tables show how the tables look after values have been inserted into them.
